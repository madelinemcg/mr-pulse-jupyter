Use:

The Jupyter notbook is set up as one block to run the interface with sections labeled for 
easy editing or adaptation. Currently Gaussian, HSn, Windowed Sinc, and Square pulses are supported.
This project was created to begin the user interface for an educational tool and eventually be hosted
as a web app.


Background:

Shaped radiofrequency (RF) pulses are widely used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Design and
optimization of these RF pulses is a broad and active research area. RF pulses are used to
manipulate the state of magnetization in a sample and can be classified by their role in an
acquisition sequence. Most commonly, pulses can be used for excitation, refocusing, and
inversion. Pulses can be designed to be selective in the spatial or spectral dimensions, or in
multiple dimensions. There are a wide range of RF pulse shapes used in the field that have
been designed and/or optimized using a variety of approaches.
The effect of an RF pulse can be simulated using the Bloch equations, which are a set of
coupled, nonlinear differential equations that describe how RF pulses change the magnetization
state of a sample. These equations are not particularly complicated, but the ability to perform
these simulations requires knowledge of MR physics, numerical analysis, and some
programming skills.
The goal of this project is to develop an easily accessible, web-based interface for RF pulse
design and simulation, implemented in the python programming language. This tool will be
valuable for students learning the fundamentals of magnetic resonance (NMR, MRI, and MRS),
pulse sequence programmers who need to optimize RF pulses for their applications, and
researchers designing new types of RF pulses.
